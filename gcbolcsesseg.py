        "When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.",
        "The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.",
        "Where there is love there is life.",
        "Prayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is daily admission of one's weakness. It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart.",
        "I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.",
        "Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.",

        "A man is but the product of his thoughts. What he thinks, he becomes.",
        "To give pleasure to a single heart by a single act is better than a thousand heads bowing in prayer.",
        "The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.",
        "Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.",

        "To believe in something, and not to live it, is dishonest.",
        "There are people in the world so hungry, that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread.",

        "Action expresses priorities.",
        "To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to woman. If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably man's superior. Has she not greater intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not greater powers of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without her, man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our being, the future is with woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to the heart than woman?",

        "It's the action, not the fruit of the action, that's important. You have to do the right thing. It may not be in your power, may not be in your time, that there'll be any fruit. But that doesn't mean you stop doing the right thing. You may never know what results come from your action. But if you do nothing, there will be no result.",

        "You can chain me, you can torture me, you can even destroy this body, but you will never imprison my mind.",
        "If I had no sense of humor, I would long ago have committed suicide.",

        "There is more to life than simply increasing its speed.",
        "I offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.",
        "Love is the strongest force the world possesses and yet it is the humblest imaginable.",
        "The simplest acts of kindness are by far more powerful then a thousand heads bowing in prayer.",
        "Remember that all through history, there have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they seem invincible. But in the end, they always fall. Always.",
        "Silence becomes cowardice when occasion demands speaking out the whole truth and acting accordingly.",
        "There is nothing that wastes the body like worry, and one who has any faith in God should be ashamed to worry about anything whatsoever.",
